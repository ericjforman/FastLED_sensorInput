# FastLED_sensorInput
 
Shows a single pixel moving in response to sensor input. A simple scrolling animation plays continuously behind it, without delaying the main loop. 

This demonstrates the use of one of FastLED's internal timer functions as opposed to using a standard delay(), in this case updating the animation every N milliseconds.
